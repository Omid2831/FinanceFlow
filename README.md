### **Version Control Strategy: GitFlow**

We follow the **GitFlow workflow**, which provides a structured branching strategy for feature development, releases, and hotfixes.

#### **GitFlow Branch Structure**

- **`main` branch** ‚Üí Contains stable production-ready code.
- **`develop` branch** ‚Üí Active development happens here.
- **Feature branches** (`feature/feature-name`) ‚Üí Used for new features.
- **Release branches** (`release/version-number`) ‚Üí Used to prepare for a new release.
- **Hotfix branches** (`hotfix/fix-name`) ‚Üí Used for urgent bug fixes in production.

#### **GitFlow Workflow Example**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Cloning the repository & setting up branches**
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Omid2831/FinanceFlow.git
cd FinanceFlow

# Set up main and develop branches
git checkout main
git checkout -b develop
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Starting a new feature**
```sh
# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Work on the feature, commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication module"

# Merge the feature branch back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge feature/user-authentication
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Creating a release branch**
```sh
# Create a release branch
git checkout -b release/v1.0.0

# Perform final tests, bug fixes, and optimizations
git commit -m "fix: resolve minor UI issues"

# Merge into main and tag the release
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.0.0
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "FinanceFlow v1.0.0 release"
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Handling hotfixes**
```sh
# Create a hotfix branch for an urgent bug
git checkout -b hotfix/fix-login-bug

# Fix the issue, commit, and merge into main
git commit -m "fix: resolve login issue"
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/fix-login-bug

# Merge the fix into develop as well
git checkout develop
git merge main
```

This ensures a **clean, structured** workflow for development and releases. üöÄ
